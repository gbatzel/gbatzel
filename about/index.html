			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am interested in understanding the genetic basis for phenotypic traits in marine organisms. My undergraduate research was focused on identifying calcification genes in larvae and juveniles of tube-buildingpolychaetes. I discovered <a href="https://gbatzel.github.io/2016/10/27/Carbonic-anhydrases-in-tubeworms.html">carbonic anhydrases</a> are uniquely expressed in glandular regions of tubeworms.  More recently I spent a summer at Friday Harbor where I conducted research on the <a href="https://gbatzel.github.io/2016/11/13/Can-larvae-sense-differences-in-pH.html">ability of urchin larvae</a> to swim under low pH conditions.</p>
