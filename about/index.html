			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am interested in understanding the molecular and evolutionary basis for biomineralization in marine organisms. My undergraduate research was focused on identifying biomineralization genes in larvae and juveniles of tube-building polychaetes. I now study shell formation in developing embryos and veligers of the gastropod, <i>Crepidula fornicata</i>.
