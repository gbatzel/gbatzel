			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am interested in understanding the genetic basis for phenotypic traits in marine organisms. My undergraduate research was focused on identifying calcification genes in larvae and juveniles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpulidae">tube-building</a> polychaetes. I discovered <a href="https://gbatzel.github.io/2016/10/27/Carbonic-anhydrases-in-tubeworms.html">carbonic anhydrases</a> are uniquely expressed in glandular regions of tubeworms.  More recently I spent a summer at <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/fhl">Friday Harbor Laboratories</a> where I conducted research on the ability of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinoderm#Larval_development">urchin larvae</a> to swim under low pH conditions.</p>
