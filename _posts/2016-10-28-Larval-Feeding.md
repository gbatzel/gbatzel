![Dendraster larva]({{ https://gbatzel.github.com }}/images/6.jpg)

#### Larva of the sand dollar, *Dendraster excentricus* held by micropipette.####

Check out this [video](https://youtu.be/Kxn4KiJZfdg) I made. Try and follow the particle trajectories as they approach the larva. You'll notice that the beads begin to speed up as they make their way towards the larva, due to the current generated by the ciliated band.
Larvae were once assumed to be passive particles floating around in the ocean, yet some have developed swimming adaptations that allow them to move quite efficiently in the water column. Urchin larvae, like the one in the video, have a ciliated band that runs around the animal and contributes to both locomotion and feeding. You can see that when held in place, the larva is able to generate current to capture small particles floating around it. Pretty neat, huh?
