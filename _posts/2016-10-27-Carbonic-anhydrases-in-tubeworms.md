title: "Carbonic anhydrases in tubeworms"
date: 2016-10-27

My manuscript was accepted for publication in the December issue of the [Biological Bulletin](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/toc/bbl/current)!!

In the paper I show biomineralization genes are expressed in locations corresponding to calcium-secreting glands in [*Hydroides elegans*](http://www.sms.si.edu/irlspec/Hydroides_elegans.htm). The enzyme I examined is called [carbonic anhydrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_anhydrase), and it catalyzes the formation of bicarbonate ions, which precipitate with calcium to form calcium carbonate. The enzyme is essential in forming the hardened skeletal structures present in coral, bivalves, sponges - and maybe, an annelid too?

The [Hadfield lab](http://www.kewalo.hawaii.edu/index.php/2013-08-02-03-42-22/faculty/michael-g-hadfield) takes a transcriptomic approach in identifying the molecular processes involved in biomineralization and metamorphosis. It's remarkable how quickly the animals can attach to substrates in water. In as little as a week juvenile tubeworms have attached themselves to the surface, and a few weeks later, the entire area will be covered with biofouling organisms.

Understanding the biology of tubeworms and how they're able to calcify will allow us to target molecular processes for calcified tube formation. Furthermore, now that we have identified two carbonic anhydrase genes in the calcium-secreting glands, we can attempt to do gene knockdowns to disrupt calcificaiton processes.
